SOME DATA:

Getting distinct number of animals intaken:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT animal_id) FROM animal_intake;

N=141420

Getting distinct number of animals outtaken:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT animal_id) FROM animal_outtake;

N=141347

Getting distinct number of animals that have been both intaken and outtaken:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT animal_outtake.animal_id) FROM animal_intake, animal_outtake where animal_intake.animal_id = animal_outtake.animal_id;

N = 140533



Earliest intake record:

SELECT datetime FROM animal_intake ORDER BY datetime ASC LIMIT 1;

10/01/2013 @ 07:51:00

Earliest outtake record:

SELECT datetime FROM animal_outtake ORDER BY datetime ASC LIMIT 1;

10/01/2013 @ 09:31:00


Latest intake record:

SELECT datetime FROM animal_intake ORDER BY datetime DESC LIMIT 1;

12/03/23 @ 13:58:00

Latest outtake record:

SELECT datetime FROM animal_outtake ORDER BY datetime DESC LIMIT 1;

12/03/23 @ 16:00:00

This dataset thus spans 10 years and 2 months.



Net intake/outtake:

SELECT
	COALESCE(intake.monthyear, outtake.monthyear) AS monthyear,
	COUNT(DISTINCT intake.animal_id) AS intake_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT outtake.animal_id) AS outtake_count
FROM
	animal_intake AS intake	
FULL OUTER JOIN
	animal_outtake as outtake
ON
	intake.monthyear = outtake.monthyear
GROUP BY
	COALESCE(intake.monthyear, outtake.monthyear)
ORDER BY
	monthyear;



Getting animal type

SELECT animal_type, month_year, COUNT(*)
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT animal_id, animal_type, month_year
	FROM animal_intake
) as unique_animals
GROUP BY animal_type, month_year;
